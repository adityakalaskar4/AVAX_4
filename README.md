## Redeem Token using Degen Token  ##
This Solidity contract implements a basic ERC20 token named DegenToken. It also includes additional functionalities for redeeming items, setting item prices, and listing available items.

## Functions in the Code ##
1. The contract owner could use this to deposit the permission to mint for a specific address and then create fresh tokens.
2. The users would burn their tokens and so reduce their token holding by themselves.
3. This enables the users to initiate redemption by entering an item name and providing a token payment.
4. This makes it possible for tokens to move from one user address to another.

6. But when you need to check your balance, just use
